### Intro to ACF (autocorrelation function) in time series data: 

Thank you to Rob Hyndman for feedback & suggestions on this series! 

#### Autocorrelation series #1

**Alt-text:** A line of related fuzzy monsters that ranges from more distant relatives (toward the left) to the current generation on the right. Several more recent generations are labeled, from “ME” on the far right, then “MY PARENT”, “MY GRANDPARENT”, “MY GREAT-GRANDPARENT” and “MY GREAT-GREAT GRANDPARENT” moving toward the left. The current generation monster on the left is saying “Hello! Meet some of my ancestors.” Stylized text at the top reads “intro to the autocorrelation function (ACF).” 

<img src="https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/blob/master/other-stats-artwork/acf_1.jpg" width="700">

#### Autocorrelation series #2

**Alt-text:** 

A friendly looking ancestral line of five monsters of simple shapes and varying color, from “My great-great grandparent” on the left to “Me!” on the right. Text says “In our family monsters tend to be a little similar to their parent and great-grandparent, very different from their grandparent, very similar to their great-great grandparent." The two monsters on the ends (great-great grandparent and current generation” are very similar in color and shape, and there is an arrow between them with text “lag = 4 generations. We are very similar!” The monsters separated by two generations (“grandparent” and current generation) are very different in color and shape, with text reading “lag = 2 generations. We are very different!”

<img src="https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/blob/master/other-stats-artwork/acf_2.jpg" width="700">

#### Autocorrelation series #3

**Alt-text:** A long series of friendly looking monsters representing generations in their family, of varying shape and color. Those separated by 4 generations are very similar in shape and color. Those separated by two generations are very dissimilar in shape and color. Text reads: “The autocorrelation function (ACF) is a plot of autocorrelation between a variable and itself separated by specified lags (in our case, generations). Let’s build one!” There is an empty plot area below.

<img src="https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/blob/master/other-stats-artwork/acf_3.jpg" width="700">

#### Autocorrelation series #4

**Alt-text:** A long series of friendly looking monsters representing generations of their family. An arc with “1” is between each subsequent monster, indicating they are separated by one generation. The text reads “At lag = 1, we find the correlation between monsters and their parent. They are somewhat positively correlated.” The ACF plot area now has a single slightly positive bar (indicating the slight positive correlation) at a value of 1 lag on the x-axis. Additional text reads “Note: since the ACF at Lag = 0 is always 1, it is often excluded.”

<img src="https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/blob/master/other-stats-artwork/acf_4.jpg" width="700">

#### Autocorrelation series #5

**Alt-text:** A long series of friendly looking monsters representing generations of their family. An arc with “2” is drawn between each monster and the one at a distance of 2 generations from it (lag = 2). Text reads “At lag = 2, we find the correlation between monsters and their grandparent. Since they tend to be very different, we find a negative correlation at lag = 2.” The ACF plot now has an additional negative bar at Lag = 2, indicating the negative correlation between each monster and their grandparent. 

<img src="https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/blob/master/other-stats-artwork/acf_5.jpg" width="700">

#### Autocorrelation series #6

**Alt-text:** A long series of friendly looking monsters representing generations of their family. An arc with “3” is drawn between each monster and the one at a distance of 3 generations from it (lag = 3). Text reads “At lag = 3, we find the correlation between monsters and their great-grandparent. They are slightly positively correlated.” The ACF plot now has an additional slightly positive bar at Lag = 3, indicating the slight positive correlation between each monster and their great-grandparent. 

<img src="https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/blob/master/other-stats-artwork/acf_6.jpg" width="700">

#### Autocorrelation series #7

**Alt-text:** 
A long series of friendly looking monsters representing generations of their family. An arc with “4” is drawn between each monster and the one at a distance of 4 generations from it (lag = 4). Text reads “At lag = 4, we find the correlation between monsters and their great-great-grandparent. They tend to be verys similar (there is a positive correlation.)” The ACF plot now has an additional positive bar at Lag = 4, indicating the positive correlation between each monster and their great-great-grandparent. 

<img src="https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/blob/master/other-stats-artwork/acf_7.jpg" width="700">

#### Autocorrelation series #8

**Alt-text:** 
A long time series of friendly looking monsters representing generations of their family. Monsters separated by 4 generations are very similar, and those separated by 2 generations are very  different. An autocorrelation function plot is show below the monsters, revealing positive correlations at lag = 4 and 8, negative correlations at lag = 2 and 5, and smaller positive correlations for other lags. The text reads “and we continue finding the correlations as we increase the lag (generations) between the monsters…”

<img src="https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/blob/master/other-stats-artwork/acf_8.jpg" width="700">

#### Autocorrelation series #9

**Alt-text:** Three very similar blue round monsters standing next to each other, looking very happy and with little hearts between them, representing monsters separated by 4 generations (so they are very similar). There is an example ACF function below them showing positive correlations at lag = 4 and 8. Text reads “In summary: the autocorrelation function (ACF) tells us the correlation between observations and those that came before them, separated by different lags (here, monster generations)!

### Tidy Data series (a collaboration for the [Openscapes blog](https://www.openscapes.org/blog/) with [Dr. Julia Lowndes](https://jules32.github.io/)!)

Please cite the following Tidy Data illustrations as: "Illustrations from the [Openscapes](https://www.openscapes.org/) blog [*Tidy Data for reproducibility, efficiency, and collaboration*](https://www.openscapes.org/blog/2020/10/12/tidy-data/) by Julia Lowndes and Allison Horst"

1. What is tidy data? 

**Alt-text:** Stylized text providing an overview of Tidy Data. The top reads “Tidy data is a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure. - Hadley Wickham.” On the left reads “In tidy data: each variable forms a column; each observation forms a row; each cell is a single measurement.” There is an example table on the lower right with columns ‘id’, ‘name’ and ‘color’ with observations for different cats, illustrating tidy data structure. 

<img src="https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/blob/master/rstats-artwork/tidydata_1.jpg" width="700">

2. Like families...

**Alt-text:**

There are two sets of anthropomorphized data tables. The top group of three tables are all rectangular and smiling, with a shared speech bubble reading “our columns are variables and our rows are observations!”. Text to the left of that group reads “The standard structure of tidy data means that “tidy datasets are all alike…” The lower group of four tables are all different shapes, look ragged and concerned, and have different speech bubbles reading (from left to right) “my column are values and my rows are variables”, “I have variables in columns AND in rows”, “I have multiple variables in a single column”, and “I don’t even KNOW what my deal is.” Next to the frazzled data tables is text “...but every messy dataset is messy in its own way. -Hadley Wickham.”

<img src="https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/blob/master/rstats-artwork/tidydata_2.jpg" width="700">

3. Comparison of work benches: 

**Alt-text:** On the left is a happy cute fuzzy monster holding a rectangular data frame with a tool that fits the data frame shape. On the workbench behind the monster are other data frames of similar rectangular shape, and neatly arranged tools that also look like they would fit those data frames. The workbench looks uncluttered and tidy. The text above the tidy workbench reads “When working with tidy data, we can use the same tools in similar ways for different datasets…” On the right is a cute monster looking very frustrated, using duct tape and other tools to haphazardly tie data tables together, each in a different way. The monster is in front of a messy, cluttered workbench. The text above the frustrated monster reads “...but working with untidy data often means reinventing the wheel with one-time approaches that are hard to iterate or reuse.”

<img src="https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/blob/master/rstats-artwork/tidydata_3.jpg" width="700"> 

4. Friends with similar tools: 

**Alt-text:** Two happy looking round fuzzy monsters, each holding a similarly shaped wrench with the word “wrangle” on it. Between their tools is held up a rectangular data table labeled “TIDY.”

<img src="https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/blob/master/rstats-artwork/tidydata_4.jpg" width="700">

5. Easier for automation & iteration!

**Alt-text:** Cute fuzzy monsters putting rectangular data tables onto a conveyor belt. Along the conveyor belt line are different automated “stations” that update the data, reading “WRANGLE”, “VISUALIZE”, and “MODEL”. A monster at the end of the conveyor belt is carrying away a table that reads “Complete analysis.” 

<img src="https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/blob/master/rstats-artwork/tidydata_5.jpg" width="700">

6. And it makes all other tidy datasets seem more welcoming! 

**Alt-text:** Digital illustration of a cute fuzzy monster holding a brief case that says "tidy data," standing beside a friendly looking data table character, being welcomed with cheers by many other data tables and another cute monster jumping with joy.

<img src="https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/blob/master/rstats-artwork/tidydata_6.jpg" width="700">

7. So make friends with tidy data! 

**Alt-text:** Digital illustration of two cute fuzzy monsters sitting on a park bench with a smiling data table between them, all eating ice cream together. In text above the illustration are the hand drawn words "make friends with tidy data."

R Knowledge Rollercoaster: 

**Alt-text:** An illustrated cartoon graph with “How much I think I know about R” on the y-axis, with axis labels at “I know nothing” and “I know lots”, versus  “time” on the x-axis. The line varies widely between the two. Above the line are emoji-like faces, showing uncertainty and hope early on. At a second peak is the label “join R community on twitter”, with a “mind-blown” emoji face. The line quickly descends, but with a happy looking emoji character sliding down it.

Derivatives thread:

**Alt-text:** A cartoon showing a sad looking yellow point on a function, with a thought bubble that reads “Hello, I am point (x, f(x)). I want to find the slope exactly where I am,  but the equation for slope requires 2 points.” The slope expression (change in y divided by the change in x) is written on the graph area.

<img src="https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/blob/master/other-stats-artwork/derivative_1.jpg" width="700">

**Alt-text:** A cartoon with two points on a function. The blue point that just showed up looks excited and is at some distance from the yellow point, with a speech bubble reading “I am your neighbor just delta x down the road, (x + delta x, f(x + delta x))! Can I help?” The yellow point responds “Well, let’s start by finding the average slope between us.”

<img src="https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/blob/master/other-stats-artwork/derivative_2.jpg" width="700">

**Alt-text:** The same two yellow and blue points separated by delta x on a function, with a green line representing the average slope between them. The equation for the average slope is show. Both points look satisfied. 

<img src="https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/blob/master/other-stats-artwork/derivative_3.jpg" width="700">

**Alt-text:** Stylized text reading “So: the average slope between any two points on a function separated by delta x is quantity f(x+ delta x) - f(x) divided by delta x.”

<img src="https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/blob/master/other-stats-artwork/derivative_4.jpg" width="700">

**Alt-text:** The same two yellow and blue points separated by delta x, but now the yellow point is looking bummed out. The blue point says “What’s wrong?” and the yellow point responds “Well, I was hoping we could find my exact slope…”

<img src="https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/blob/master/other-stats-artwork/derivative_5.jpg" width="700">

**Alt-text:** Close up montage of the blue point, thinking hard about different ways to calculate an exact slope. In gray text behind them are equations for slope, tangents, delta x, crumpled papers. Finally in the third illustration in the montage, the blue point is holding their arms up in victory with a lightbulb above them and the word “LIMITS.”

<img src="https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/blob/master/other-stats-artwork/derivative_6.jpg" width="700">

**Alt-text:** Two cartoon points on a function. The blue point is swooping down toward the yellow point, yelling “I’M COMING OVER!” The yellow point looks kind of stunned and says “what.” The blue point responds “If I get really close to you, then our average slope will be close to your exact slope!” On the x-axis is gray text reading “delta x is shrinking!” as the two points move closer together. 

<img src="https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/blob/master/other-stats-artwork/derivative_7.jpg" width="700">

**Alt-text:** Two cartoon points on a function, now very close together and with the blue point continuing to move toward the yellow point. In a speech bubble, the blue point says “And if the distance between us gets infinitely small (delta x approaches 0), our AVERAGE SLOPE becomes the INSTANTANEOUS SLOPE at a single point!” The yellow point now looks very happy. 

<img src="https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/blob/master/other-stats-artwork/derivative_8.jpg" width="700">

**Alt-text:** A single green point, looking victorious with arms raised, which is now representing the yellow and blue points have converged (delta x is infinitely small). Text reads “The expression for the instantaneous slope at any point on a function, aka the derivative, is found by (1) Finding an expression for the slope between two points on the function separated by delta x, and (2) evaluating that slope as the points get infinitely close together.”

<img src="https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/blob/master/other-stats-artwork/derivative_9.jpg" width="700">

usethis (seriously...):

**Alt-text:** Two round fuzzy monsters, one riding on the shoulders of the other, who is carrying it up a mountain. The monster riding on the shoulders is labeled “Me” and is saying “so productive!”, , and the one carrying it is labeled “usethis.” The mountain has faint text reading “so many things…” and a small flag at the top reading “yay.”

Faces of debugging: 

**Alt-text:** A cartoon of a fuzzy round monster face showing 10 different emotions experienced during the process of debugging code. The progression goes from (1) “I got this” - looking determined and optimistic; (2) “Huh. Really thought that was it.” - looking a bit baffled; (3) “...” - looking up at the ceiling in thought; (4) “Fine. Restarting.” - looking a bit annoyed; (5) “OH WTF.” Looking very frazzled and frustrated; (6) “Zombie meltdown.” - looking like a full meltdown; (7) (blank) - sleeping; (8) “A NEW HOPE!” - a happy looking monster with a lightbulb above; (9) “insert awesome theme song” - looking determined and typing away; (10) “I love coding” - arms raised in victory with a big smile, with confetti falling.

## Make your own sample cartoons!

I'm building this library of samples, faces & arms so that statistics teachers can create their own fun, charismatic samples to include in stats lectures, slides & materials. The files below contain different graphs (dotplots, histograms, more to come) with matching arms doing different things, along with a file of faces you can add on top to give them some personality. I recommend playing with transparency, brightness, cropping & size in whatever program you use to piece these together! Working on making these PNGs & SVGs. 

#### Here are some examples of DIY creations:
